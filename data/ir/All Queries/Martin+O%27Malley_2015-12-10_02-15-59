Her friends on Wall Street from the big banks, have given her hundreds of thousands of dollars in speakin fees, and are the ones that will be guiding our country's economic policies should Hillary Clinton be elected. I think that notion was shameful. I don't think the people watching were applauding the notion that she was putting up this smokescreen and wrapping herself in the tragedy of 9/11, I don't think they saw that as something that is appropriate to do, to mask her coziness and her closeness to Wall Street and all of the architects of the crash of 2008.",
